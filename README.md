Staff Management: Maintain records of library staff, their roles, and work shifts.
Reader Management: Keep track of library members, their book issues, and fines.
Book Issuance: Record and manage the issuance and return of books, including fines for late returns.
Library Settings: Configure global library settings, including book issue limits and fine rates.
